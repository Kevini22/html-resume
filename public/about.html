  Hi! My name is Kevin Monge Fonseca. I was born in Costa Rica on May 14th, 1999. 
  At the age of three my family and I moved to the United States. We first lived in New Jersey for a short amount of 
  time until moving to Upstate New York. I grew up in a town called Endwell, 
  a location that will always hold a place in my heart.
  After returning to Costa Rica in 2015, I graduated highschool and began a long 
  and arduous college experience. Currently I am a studying Sociology in the 
  National University of Costa Rica in Heredia. Although my experience with this 
  career choice has been lacking, around the begining of 2023 I was lucky enough 
  to finally be able to determine the career path that I want to go into.<br />

  After deciding to take a vocational course, or technical course, my perspective 
  took a completely different turn as to what I wanted to do in life. I had 
  struggled for years trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I came across 
  an advert promoting a course called Data Analysis offered by the Castro Carazo University, which 
  at the time looked like it would benefit my choice in Sociology. I didn't look 
  into reading about what the course had to offer, I simply applied and payed 
  the fee. And turns out, this would be the greatest outcome to a misunderstanding 
  in my life.

  Half way through 2023 and my life seems like it couldn't be falling in any better. 
  The Data Analysis course not only ended up introducing me to Python, but the 
  world of programming as well. There is still a lot left for me to go through in 
  in this course like the actual data analysis with python module as well as machine 
  learning, but the interest that I've generated in this field has helped me develop 
  a lot of skills.<br />
  I was fortunate enough to receive a job as a Junior Content Developer working 
  for a company known as Sib√∫ Digital. My experience with this company was my 
  introduction to web development. It appealed to me so much so that I decided 
  to purchase a course from Udemy, The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp, so 
  that I could further my self within this industry. So far I have learned a lot about 
  HTML and how to create websites with it. There is still so much to learn like CSS and 
  Java Script. When I do get to that part of the course, this paragraph will end up 
  looking different than it is now.
