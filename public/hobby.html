<h2 Style="font-family:Segoe UI Light">Free Time</h2>

<p Style="font-family:Segoe UI">
  In my free time, I enjoy watching videos and listening to music on YouTube. 
  I recently became interested in web development and programming, and I now 
  use YouTube to learn more about those fields. I find that watching videos 
  and tutorials on YouTube is a great way to learn new skills and stay 
  up-to-date on the latest trends in web development and programming. 
  I also enjoy using YouTube to find inspiration for my own projects.

<h2 Style="font-family:Segoe UI Light" >Benjen</h2>

<p Style="font-family:Segoe UI">
  My German Shepherd, Benjen, is the most important being in my life. I met 
  him in 2021 when he was just a puppy. He was born in May, the same month 
  as me, and he just turned 2 years old. I love giving him attention and 
  playing with him, not just because I want him to be happy, but also 
  because interacting with him helps me relieve stress and puts me in a good place.
  Benjen is always there for me, no matter what. He is my best friend and I don't 
  know what I would do without him. I am so grateful to have him in my life.

<h2 style="font-family:Segoe UI Light">Web Development and Programing Skills</h2>
<p Style="font-family:Segoe UI">
  I've grown particularily fond of Web Development. It's something I can very easily 
  grasp and an industry I can comfortably picture myself in.Developing my skills 
  feels more like a fun activity as everything that I achieve has a rewarding 
  effect on me. I also like practicing and developing my programming skills with 
  Python. Along with Web Development, I am also developing my skills in Data Analysis.
  I have been using Python as the programming language for this because it's particularily
  useful of Data Science and Analytics.

  Future Project
</h2>

<p Style="font-family:Segoe UI">
  I've decided to want to work an a personal project in the future that involves 
  creating a video game using all the new skills that I have learned as well as many 
  others I've yet to learn. I want to be able to understand the basic concepts and principles
  that revolve around game development so it wil take a lot research and study but for
  now I've decided that I want to learn C++ to develop the game, although this can change.
  I've already got a great design for a character and an idea for how the game will be played
  out, but I'm going to develop these ideas further while I learn all the other necessary
  skills required to creating a video game.
